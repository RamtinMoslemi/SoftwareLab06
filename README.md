1. GoF Patterns:

    **Creational Patterns**: Deal with initializing and configuring classes and objects.

    **Structural Patterns**: Deal with decoupling interface and implementation of classes and
objects.

    **Behavioral Patterns**: Deal with dynamic interactions among societies of classes and objects.


2. Both **_State_** and **_Strategy_** are **Behavioral Patterns**:

    **_State_**: Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

    **_Strategy_**: Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable; lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

3. **_Singleton_**: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
